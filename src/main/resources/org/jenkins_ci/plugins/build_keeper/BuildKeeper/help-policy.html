    <div>
        <p>Choose which builds are selected to be kept<br/>
        See the documentation on the <a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Keeper+Plugin" target="_blank">wiki</a> for more information.</p>
        
        <dl><dt>Keep based on build number</dt>
            <dd>This policy will look at the build number and will decide whether to keep only on the build number and whether <em>Dont keep failed</em> is
            checked.<br/>
            As this policy is not based on historical information, you can use a discard policy that only keeps a low (say 30) builds,
            but <em>Keep every</em> can be set to 100, and every 100 builds will be kept e.g. 1, 101, 201.<br/>
            The build number sequence is not affected if a build that would have been kept, was not kept because it was not good enough and <em>Dont keep
            failed</em> is selected.<br/>
            In the example above, if <em>Dont keep failed</em> is selected and build 101 failed, then the next build to keep will still be
            201, regardless of how many successful builds there were in between.</dd>
        
            <dt>Keep since last kept</dt>
            <dd>This policy will look backwards through the builds to find out whether a build has keep forever set within the <em>Keep every</em> range,
            and if not, then this build will be kept.<br/>
            This means that if a build has been kept for any other reason, eg manually selected, or via a promotion, then the period will reset
            and unnecessary builds will not be kept.<br/>
            If a build that would have been kept is not kept because <em>Dont keep failed</em> is selected, then the next successful build will be kept.</dd>
            
            <dt>Keep the first successful build every x days</dt>
            <dd>This policy is similar to the <em>Keep since last kept</em> policy, except that the units are days, and failed builds are not kept.</dd>
        </dl>
